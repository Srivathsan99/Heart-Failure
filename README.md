# Heart-Failure

•	Dataset that contains the person and health information of various candidates.<br>
•	Heatmap used to visually see the correlation between the feature to determine the required feature.<br>
•	Scaling is done using the sklearn library to bring the range of value between 0 and 1.<br>
•	Balancing is done by oversampling the class 1 as about 67% of the target were 0.<br>
•	Using cross-fold validation for model selection to know the model with consistent performance.<br>
•	Ensemble models such as Random Forest and xgboost performed consistently better.<br>
•	Learning curve to know more about test and train score.<br>
•	Recall is used as evaluation as it is more suited for this scenario.<br>
